        Fresh egg pasta dough is a traditional Italian dough used to make fresh pasta. It is made primarily from flour and eggs.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Tipo 00 flour</li>
        <li>Free range eggs</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Note</h2>
    <p>
        The hydration level, or the ratio of eggs to flour, is crucial for achieving the right texture. 
        A typical ratio is 55-57% hydration, meaning for every 100 grams of flour, you would use 55-57 grams of eggs.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Mixing: Start by making a well in the center of a mound of flour on a clean work surface. 
            Break the eggs into the well and use a fork to gently mix the eggs with the flour, gradually incorporating more flour as you mix. 
            Alternatively, you can whisk the eggs in a separate bowl and then add them to the well.
        </li>

            Kneading: Once a rough dough is formed, knead the dough for about 8 to 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. 
            If the dough feels too dry, sprinkle your fingers with a little water and continue kneading. 
            If itâ€™s too sticky, dust more flour onto your work surface.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Resting: After kneading, divide the dough into halves and pat each half into an approximately 1-inch-thick square. 
            Wrap the dough tightly in plastic and let it rest for at least 1 hour and up to 3 hours before using.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Rolling and Cutting: After resting, the dough can be rolled out and cut into various pasta shapes. 
            To prevent sticking, dust the dough and the pasta cutter with semolina flour.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Cooking: Fresh pasta cooks much quicker than dried pasta.
            Depending on the thickness of the pasta, it can cook in as little as 1-3 minutes.
            Bring a large pan of salted water to the boil, add the pasta and cook until al dente.
        </li>
    </ol>
