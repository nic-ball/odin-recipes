    <p>Ragù alla Bolognese, also known as Bolognese sauce, is a meat-based sauce typical of Bologna, Italy. It is traditionally used to dress tagliatelle al ragù and to prepare lasagne alla bolognese. The sauce is made by slowly cooking a mixture of minced or finely chopped beef, often alongside small amounts of fatty pork, with a soffritto of onion, celery, and carrot. White wine, milk, and a small amount of tomato paste or tomato sauce are added, and the dish is then gently simmered for a long time to produce a thick sauce.</p>
