    <p>Ragù alla Bolognese, also known as Bolognese sauce, is a meat-based sauce typical of Bologna, Italy. It is traditionally used to dress tagliatelle al ragù and to prepare lasagne alla bolognese. The sauce is made by slowly cooking a mixture of minced or finely chopped beef, often alongside small amounts of fatty pork, with a soffritto of onion, celery, and carrot. White wine, milk, and a small amount of tomato paste or tomato sauce are added, and the dish is then gently simmered for a long time to produce a thick sauce.</p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Melt the pork belly (first diced and finely chopped with a crescent-shaped knife) in a large and preferably earthenware pan of approx. cm. 20.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Finely chop the vegetables and add them to the pan with the pancetta as the fat renders down.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Add the minced beef and brown it well, stiring continuously with a wooden spoon.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Pour ½ glass of white wine into the pan, stir gently until it has evaporated.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Add the passata or chopped tomatoes and let simmer for 2 hours, adding a little broth from time to time when the sauce gets too thick.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Add the milk to soften the acidity of the tomatoes and season with salt and pepper.
            Let simmer for a further 20 mins, adjusting the seasoning if necessary.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Serve with fresh tagliatelle, made as the ragu is simmering using the <a href="../recipes/pasta-dough.html">Fresh Egg Pasta Dough</a> recipe.
